/*
    Create a struct Fraction that holds the numerator and denominator of a fraction as fields.
    A fraction is the division of two rational numbers (e.g. 22 / 7, where 22 is the numerator and 7 is the denominator).
•	The struct constructor takes the numerator and denominator as arguments. They are integer numbers
    in the range [-9223372036854775808…9223372036854775807]. 
•	Validate the input through properties. The denominator cannot be 0. Throw proper exceptions with descriptive messages.
•	Overload the + and - operators to perform addition and subtraction on objects of type Fraction. The result should be a new Fraction.
•	Override ToString() to print the fraction in floating-point format.
